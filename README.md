# NLayeredAppDemo
It is a multi-layered demo that can be easily applied to any type of project while creating multi-layered architectural code.
This demo example consists of entities, data access, business and UI layers.
Northwind database and sql server designed by Microsoft are used.
The benefit of layered architectures is that they can be integrated very easily when it is desired to switch to different UI, different database types and many different technologies.
This demo example is a simple example in terms of creating different layers and can be easily shaped according to the project to be used.
